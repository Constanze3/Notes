### Proving that a function is one-to-one

A quick example would be $x^2+xcos(x)$ where $x\geq0$
The derivative is $2x+cos(x)-sin(x)x$

$x(2-sin(x))+cos(x) \geq x+cos(x)>0$

Since $cos(x)$ starts off at 0, when it would go into negative $x$ is already bigger then $1$

Since the derivative is always greater than 0 it's strictly increasing and so one-to-one.
