**Linearization** simply means first order Taylor expansion. So $f(a)+ \frac{f'(a)(x-a)}{1!}$ or just simply $f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)$ where $a$ is the point of approximation.

When calculating the **distance between the point and a plane**, since we are using a simple normal vector make sure to take it's length into account.

**one-to-one** by definition means $f(x_1)=f(x_2)\Rightarrow x_1=x_2$
to show that a method is one-to-one it is enough to show that is strictly increasing or decreasing, which can be seen by taking a look at the derivative.

When searching for the **derivative of the inverse** you sometimes have to **guess** where the function would take the certain y value. Because sometimes not only is it impossible to isolate y in the inverse, but it's impossible to calculate the value as well.

For **limits** don't be afraid to use taylor series if necessary and use O.

With **mean value theorem** move everything to right side and then in the bottom you can see what you need for $b$ and you guess $a$ and the top also suggests the function. Also the definition:
$\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} = f'(c)$

(The slope of a normal line of a line in 2D is the negative reciprocal of the slope.)

The **distance of a point and a line** can be calculted by substracting the point from the line, that will give us an infinite collection of vectors pointing from the point to the line. We know that from this collection the distance vector's dot product with the line's direction vector will be 0. Solving the equation we will get the direction vector, to get the distance we just need it's length.

If a function is not differentiable if it is not continous. To check if a partial function is continous you check the limit at the vertex of the 2 parts is the same. To check if it's differentiable we need that the function is continous and both parts are differentiable everywhere.

Divergence means the limit doesn't exist.

When you need the **amount of the solutions** for a polynomial factorize and use the discriminant.

Derivative of $|x| = \frac{x}{|x|}$ 

To cheat a limit that looks complicated going to infinity, just put in a large number to approximate just put in a a big number (not even that big maybe 10).
